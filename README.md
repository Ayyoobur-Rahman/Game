A small Windows Forms 2D platformer prototype inspired by Regular Show that demonstrates player movement, jump physics, collision handling, item interactions (coins, multipliers, speed boosts), enemy movement, and score tracking; to review the game logic and behavior open Form1.cs in the video game project (build and run the solution in Visual Studio to test movement with Left/Right and Space).
